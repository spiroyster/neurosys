Requirements:

Need to load save layers/models and their states.

layer -> has x number of cells. (aka 1D array... aka tensor)

So the connection is the weight...
The neuron has the activation...
Neuron has bias...

The bias is what the activation function needs to exceed in order to fire?


So essentially a neuron has the activation function and bias.

Layer has neurons with same activation function, but different bias.

nueral model (input -> layer -> layer -> output);

When compiling a model. layers are connected in in->out fashion left to right... 

Each layer given an ID in ascending order...

then the synpases/connections can be constructed/queried on the fly...

A1 ------ B1
       /
 A2B1 /
     /
    /
A2 /------ B2


So they are stored like this...

An = activation function and bias
AnBn = weight

[A1] [A1B1 A1B2 A1B3 ... A1Bn]
[A2] [A2B1 A2B2 A2B3 ... A2Bn]

[B1] [B1C1 B1C2 ... B1Cn]
[B2] [B2C1 B2C2 ... B2Cn]


[C1]
[C2]

to construct B -> A we can take the column  ...

i.e for B3 -> An 
A1 [2]
A2 [2]
A3 [2]
etc..
